Here's an attempt to generate an assembler+disassembler+interpreter for the DCPU16 architecture, based on the spec at http://dcpu.com/highnerd/dcpu16.txt

Really the idea isn't to generate it - just parse the tables in the spec into nice LUTs full of instruction-machine code mappings and operational semantics.

Highly experimental WIP, needless to say.
